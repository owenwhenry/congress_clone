# cdg_api
This project is intended to be a lightweight implementation of a local database 
of federal legislation. My hope is that this is a convenient jumpstart for 
any research projects interested in this dataset - it's rich, well-curated, and
contains a record of how Americans have chosen to govern themselves. 

(it's also a practice project, so forgive me my sins - if you log issues in the
project, I promise to get around to them eventually!)

I'd like to acknowledge the team at the Library of Congress that has labored
tirelessly to make this data available. I'd also like to thank the staff 
working in the House and the Senate. I couldn't do what you do, but it's your 
work that makes this possible. Thanks.
